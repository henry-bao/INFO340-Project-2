# Info 340 Project 2 —— Goal Husky!
This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://goal-husky.web.app/>

## Project Description
During the 2020 quarantine period, many students are complaining that their productivity dramatically dropped in the everyday online era. In order to increase the sense of accomplishment both in their personal and academic lives, and also connect UW students back with each other, one of the ideas we think about is to create a website that they can help find and keep track of everyday goals with each other.

Goal Husky is a website that aims to help UW students **find like-minded people** to achieve their same goal. And this project is a continuous project from project-1 contributed by Henry Bao and Johnny He.

## Function Introduction
This website is facing all **UW students**. In such a remote living mode, we hope to help students keep in touch with each other and at the same time increase social networking with other UW students.

On our **Home page**, the card deck gives our user an overview of goals posted. On the card, they can see the title, the category, the number of current people who want to join the goal, and the description in a shorter version of the goal. More details would display out once students click the card.

To find the events that users want to join quicker, all activities posted on the website would be **sorted according to their type** (for example hobbies; health; career...). In this case, students can **easily search** for their interesting fields through the category we listed above. Or they can **type in some keywords** in the search bar to look for the one they are interested in.

After finding out the one they are interested in, they can see the detailed description by clicking the card.  After clicking the card, they can either click **the left or the right button** to see other goals.

On each detail page, users can see the remaining time of that event if they scroll down a little bit. After viewing all the details of it, users can click the **Count me in** button to join with the creator. But they need to **sign in** first by using either a google account or email. Otherwise, a warning would be shown out and saying "You haven't signed in!". After a user signs in successfully, they can join the event! After they have joined the event, the "Count me in!" button would not be available.

With this concise and comprehensive structure, students can easily check if the goal aligns with their interest, schedule, and determine how much time and energy they are expected to put into the goal.

User can **publish** they goal if they fail to find the one they want to join in the existing events. In this case, they can publish any goal by clicking the **Publish Now!** button. <br>
In the **"Publish Now!**, founders are required to provide a detailed description of the goal.<br>

The following questions are the basic information of the goal:
<ul>
  <li>Goal in one word</li>
  <li>Category of the goal</li>
  <li>Expected day to take the goal</li>
  <li>Description: tell others what your goal is about</li>
  <li>Contact information</li>
  <li>Related image/pictures of your goals</li>
</ul>

After finishing the questions provided, they can simply click the **Send** button, or they can click the **Close** to close.

**Ranking page** combines the message of Goal, its description, and current people inside. The ranking is based on the current people inside. Users can change the rank order by clicking "People" at the top of the form.
