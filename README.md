# Info 340 Project 2 —— Goal Husky!
This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://firebase-project-id.firebaseapp.com//>

## Project Description
During the 2020 quarantine period, many students complaining that their productivity is dramatically dropped in the everyday online mode. In order to increase the sense of accomplishment both in their life and academic, and also connect UW students back with each other, one of the ideas we think about is to create a website that they can help find and keep track of everyday goals with each other.

 Goal Husky is a website that aims to help UW students to **find like-minded people** to achieve their same goal. And this project is a continuous project from project-1 contributed by Henry Bao and Johnny He.


## Function Introduction
This website is facing to all **UW students**. In such a remote living mode, we hope to help students to keep in touch with each other and at the same time increase social networking with other UW students.

On this website, UW students can **post any goal** that they want to finish with others by clicking the publish button. Users can simply type the name of the goal and attach a related photo to help others learn the activities easier.

All the activities posted on the website would be **sorted according to their type** (for example: hobbies; health; career...). In this case, students can **easily search** for their interesting fields through the category we listed above. Or they can **type in some keywords** in the search bar to look for the one they are interested in.

After finding out the one they are interested in, they can see the detailed description by clicking the card. The overview of the main goal of the activity, duration time will shown out. After viewing all the details of it, users can click the **"Join Now"** button to join with the creator. After that, the founder's contact information will be provided. There is also a **weekly checklist** to keep participants follow the time, and the complete result will be visually shown out weekly. With this concise and comprehensive structure, other users can easily check if the goal aligns with their interest, schedule, and determine how much time and energy they are expected to put into the goal.

_Details_ <br>
In the "Publish Page", founders are required to provide the details description of the goal.<br>
The following questions are the basic information of the goal:
<ul>
  <li>Goal Name</li>
  <li>Description: tell others what your goal is about</li>
  <li>How Many Weeks Will The Goal Take?</li>
  <li>Related image/pictures of your goals</li>
</ul>


In the "Join Now" Page, there are functions like:
<ul>
  <li>Week 1: The Object is to finished...</li>
  <li>Week 2: The Object is to finished...</li>
  <li>Week 3: The Object is to finished...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>Congratulations! You have already finished the goal! <br> What's next?</li>
</ul>

They will also post out a weekly checklist in every week. In this case, users can click the yes button once they finished the task. With the checklist provided, we hope to keep the passion and motivation of participants.
